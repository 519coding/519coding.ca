            <h1>What in the world is a string?</h1>
            <p>
                No, we are not referring to a piece of yarn that your cat plays with. Strings are a unique and useful data type in Python.In our previous lessons, you have already seen strings being used in our print functions: <code>print("Hello World")</code>. Strings are used to produce text. This text is output to the compiler using the <code>print()</code> function. Click the button below to see this in action:

            <h1>String Literals</h1>
            <p>
                Strings are a unique data type in most programming languages. Integers and Floats are basic objects that aren't made up of anything else. However, Strings are a sequence of characters. For example, 
                <code>
                    "Hello, World!"
                </code> 
                is made up of the characters
                <code>
                    "H", "e", "l", "l", "o", ",", " ", "W", "o", "r", "l", "d", "!"
                </code>
                . This property of Strings allows us to do several interesting things with them.
            </p>

            <h1>String Concatenation</h1>
            <p>
                We can aslo combine different strings into one big string, using the <code>+</code> operator: <br> <code>print("Hello" <mark>+</mark> ", " <mark>+</mark> "world!")</code>. This is called <i>string concatenation</i>. <br>Click the button below to see this in action:

            <h1>String Indices and Slices</h1>
            <p>
                In Python, you are able to retrieve specific characters from a string. All characters in a string are have an number index assigned to them. BUT! Instead of starting at 1, the index of the leftmost character is 0 and the last character is the length of the string minus 1. This is called a zero-based numbering system.

            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose:
            </p>
                <code>
                    s = "Monty Python"
                </code>
            <p>
                What if you wanted to use only the first character of that string, "M"?
            </p>

            <p>
                Doing this is actually quite simple. To get a character from a string, type the variable name with set of square brackets after the variable name. The square brackets should contain the index of the character you want to retrieve.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also retrieve a <i>Slice</i> of a string. A slice is just a string contained within a string.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/s-index1.png"></img>
            <p>The square bracket now takes two arguments that are separated by a colon. The first value is the index of the starting character, the second value is the index of the ending character PLUS ONE!!!!! NOTE! The first argument is <b>INCLUSIVE</b> the second argument is <b>EXCLUSIVE</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/s-index2.png"></img>
            <img src="../../images/s-index3.png"></img>
            <img src="../../images/s-index4.png"></img>
            <p>
                If the value before or after the colon is left empty, then the index will be set to either the start or the end of the string.
            </p>
            <p>
                What if you wanted to have every second character in a string? Well, the square brackets can take a third value, also separated by a colon, called the <i>step</i>.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/s-index5.png"></img>
            <img src="../../images/s-index6.png"></img>
            <img src="../../images/s-index7.png"></img>
            <p>
                In the last two examples you can see that when the step is negative, you get a string that is reversed. NOTE! When the step is negative, then the starting index must be the higher index, and the ending index must be the lower index.
