            <h1>What in the world is a string?</h1>
            <p>
                No, we are not referring to a piece of yarn that your cat plays with. Strings are a unique and useful data type in Python. In our previous lessons, you have already seen strings being used in our <code>print()</code> functions: <code>print(<mark>"Hello World"</mark>)</code>.</p>
                <p>Strings are used to produce text. We tell the computer that we are working with a string by enclosing our text between either a pair of double quotation marks &#8594; " " or single quotation marks &#8594; ' '. The text we enclose between these quotation marks is output to the compiler using the <code>print()</code> function. 
            </p>

            <h1>String Literals</h1>
            <p>
                Strings are a unique data type in most programming languages. Integers and Floats are basic objects that aren't made up of anything else. However, Strings are a sequence of characters, which may include letters, spaces, numbers, or punctuation marks/symbols. For example, <code>"Hello World!"</code> is made up of 12 characters (10 letters, 1 space, 1 punctuation mark). This property of Strings allows us to do several interesting things with them. We'll talk about them below:</p>

            <h1>String Concatenation</h1>
            <p>
                One of the cool things we can do with strings is <i>concatenate</i> them. Concatenate is just a fancy word for combining things together. We combine/concatenate different strings into one big string using the <code>+</code> operator: <code>print("Hello" <mark>+</mark> ", " <mark>+</mark> "world!")</code>. This is called <i>string concatenation</i>. Check out the code below to see this in action:     
  
            <div data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="python">
	              <code data-type="sample-code">
                # You can concatenate strings using the '+' operator, like this:
                print ("Hello" + ", " + "world!")

                # You can also concatenate strings by assigning them to variables, like this:

                string1 = ("519coding.ca")
                string2 = (" is the best website for programming lessons")

                # Now we put them together

                print (string1+string2)
               
                # Click 'Submit' to see these strings in action!

                </code>
	            
                <code data-type="solution">
                # You can concatenate strings using the '+' operator, like this:
                print ("Hello" + ", " + "world!")

                # You can also concatenate strings by assigning them to variables, like this:

                string1 = ("519coding.ca")
                string2 = (" is the best website for programming lessons")

                # Now we put them together

                print (string1+string2)

                # Click 'Submit' to see these strings in action!

                </code>
	            
                <code data-type="sct">
		            test_function("print")
		            success_msg("Pretty cool eh?")
	              </code>

      	    <div data-type="hint">We use the <code>+</code> to concatenate the three variables.</div>
            </div>

            <h1>String Indices</h1>
            <p>
                Another cool thing you can do with strings is retrieve specific characters from them. All characters in a string have an number index assigned to them. BUT! Instead of starting at 1, the index of the leftmost character is 0 and the last character is the length of the string minus 1. This is called a zero-based numbering system. 
            <figure>
		            <img src="../../images/array-indexing.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig 1. - Index [0] is assigned to the first letter, index [1] is assigned to the second letter, index [2] is assigned to the third letter and so on and so forth.</figcaption>
	          </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say you only want to print the first letter of a string:
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose:
            </p>
                <code>
                    s = "Monty Python"
                </code>
            <p>
                Doing this is actually quite simple. To get a specific character from a string, type the variable name with set of square brackets after the variable name. The square brackets should contain the index of the character you want to retrieve.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index0.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig 2. - Index [0] gives us the first letter of the string assigned to variable 's'. Since we assigned the string "Monty Python" to the variable 's', the first letter of this string is the letter 'M'.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
                Try it yourself in the editor below:
            </p>

            <div data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="python">
	              <code data-type="sample-code">
                # Use a print() function to print out the third letter of the word "Python". It has been assigned to the variable below:

                a = "Python"

                # The letter 'o' should be output to the compiler. Write your print() function in the line below:

                </code>
	            
                <code data-type="solution">
                a = "Python"
                print(a[4])                
                </code>
	            
                <code data-type="sct">
		            test_function("print")
		            success_msg("You did it!")
	              </code>

      	    <div data-type="hint">The third character of the string is represented be index [4].</div>
            </div>
            
            <h2>"Slicing" a string</h2>
            <p>
                You can also retrieve a <i>Slice</i> of a string. A slice is just a string contained within a string. Check out the figure below to see how we "slice" a string into different segments:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index1.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig 3. This creates a "slice" of every character starting from index 1, up to but not including index 5.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The square bracket now contains two values that are separated by a colon. The first value is the index of the starting character, the second value is the index of the ending character PLUS ONE!!!!! NOTE! The first argument is <b>INCLUSIVE</b> the second argument is <b>EXCLUSIVE</b>. Check out the figures below to see some of these "slices" in action.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index2.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 4 - This creates a "slice" of the first 5 characters of "Monty Python"
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index3.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 5 - This creates a "slice" of every character after character number 1</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index4.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 6 - Since there are no values assigned before or after the colon, the "slice" begins at the first character and ends at the last character.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <h2>Trickier slices</h2>
            <p>
                What if you wanted to have every second character in a string? Or maybe you want to print letters of your string in reverse order? Well, the square brackets can take a third value, also separated by a colon, called the <i>step</i>.
            </p>
            <figure>    
                <img src="../../images/s-index5.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 7 - By setting the <i>step</i> equal to 2, we produce a slice of every second character </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index6.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 8 - When we set the <i>step</i> equal to a negative value, we get our string in reverse order</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/s-index7.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 9 - Here's a tricky one! This gives  us every second character starting at index [9], up to but not including index [1]. Since the <i>step</i> is a negative number, our slice is produced in reverse order. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/monty-python.png" width="600" height="350"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 10 - Here is an explanation of Fig. 9 - As you can see [9:1:-2] creates the following slice of characters: "h yt". Our slice consists of every second character from index [9] up to but not including index [1]. Since the <i>step</i> value is negative, the characters of our slice are in reverse order.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
               NOTE! When the step is negative, then the starting index must be the higher index, and the ending index must be the lower index. For the example above, the starting index is 9 and the ending index is 1.
            </p>

		            success_msg("You did it!")
	              </code>

      	    <div data-type="hint">The square bracket should look like this [::2] with the first two values left blank and the "step" value equal to 2.</div>
