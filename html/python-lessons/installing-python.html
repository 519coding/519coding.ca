    <h1>Installing Python.</h1>
    It's quite helpful to have the latest version of Python installed on your computer. To do this, go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"  target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a> and scroll to the bottom of the page where you'll find the installation options for both Windows and Mac. But before you do this, you might want to explore the second option below.
    <h1>Using an online editor</h1>
    <p>If you don't want to go through the hassle of installing Python on your computer, you can use an online editor instead. We personally recommend using <a href="https://repl.it/"  target="_blank">https://repl.it/</a> because it is easy to use and supports multiple programming languages, not just Python. While using online editors is a great option for novice level programmers, they have quite a few limitations. However, they'll work just fine for learning the basics of Python. When you're reading through our lessons, we encourage you to test out some of the concepts we teach on your own, using either a downloaded version of Python or an online editor. </p>
