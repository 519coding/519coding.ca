            <h1>Now What?</h1>
            <p>
                You've probably finished reading all of our lessons now right? (Or you skipped all of them :[ ) This tutorial was 
                only an extremely basic introduction. There's still a lot that we haven't covered (Containers, Functions, Object-Oriented
                Programming, Modules, Built-in Functions, File I/O, to name a few), but you've only gotten your feet wet. You can only 
                learn so much from random articles. The best way to learn coding is with trial & error and problem solving, so how 
                about we direct you to some resources that can help you really dive into programming.

                <li><a href="https://snakify.org/en/">Snakify.org</a> - This site is where I learnt nearly all of my Python 3 when I 
                began coding.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> - This is one of our favourites. HackerRank gives you hundreds 
                of challenging problems that really put your programming skills to the test.</li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/"> Python 3 Documentation</a> - The official Python 3 documentation is an exhaustive 
                compilation of Python 3's concepts, functions, mechanics, and more written by the guys who created Python. We highly recommend 
                you visit the documentation whenever you have any questions about Python 3.</li>
