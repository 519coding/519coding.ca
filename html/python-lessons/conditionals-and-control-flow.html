            <h1>Algorithms</h1>
            <p>
                Essentially, everything in the universe relies on <i>Algorithms</i> to work. Algorithms are a set of instructions that are used
                to accomplish a goal. They are especially important in programming because computers need algorithms to generate an output.
                If, Elif, and Else statements are essential to programming because they tell a computer what to do in different situations. Maybe you
                want to sort a bag of multi-colored marbles into baskets of the same color. You could tell the computer: "If the marble is red, put 
                it into the red basket. Otherwise, if it is blue, put it in the blue basket. Otherwise, throw the marble into the garbage."
            </p>
            
            <h1>If, Elif, Else</h1>
            <p>Let's take a look at this program.</p>
            <img src="../../images/control-flow-program.png"></img>
            <ol>
                <li> It defines variables x and y that are equal to 213 and 1234 respectively.</li>
                <li> The first statement checks if x + y is equal to 12. If x + y is in fact equal to 12, the program would print
                    "Yay!".</li>
                <li> If x + y does not equal 12, the program moves to the elif statement. If x + y >= 12, it would print "Woohoo!".</li>
                <li> In this case, x + y is greater than or equal to 12, meaning that the program would print "Woohoo!" and stop. 
                    However, if x + y was smaller than 12, the program would move on to the else statement.</li>
                <li> On the else statement, the program would print "Awwww :(".</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>So what can we learn about if, elif, and else?</p>
            <ul>
                <li> If the boolean expression after the if statement evaluates to True, the code indented after the if statement is 
                    executed and the computer exits the conditional block.</li>
                <li> If the boolean expression after the if statement evaluates to Fales, the computer moves on to the elif statement to check 
                    if its boolean expression evaluates to True.</li>
                <li> If all else evaluates to False, the computer will execute the code indented after the else statement.</li>
                <li> Note: You are not forced to have if, elif, and else in a conditional block, only the if statement is needed.</li>
            </ul>
