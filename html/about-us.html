    <p>The goal of this website is to introduce students of all ages to the world of coding and give them the skills and knowledge required to create projects of their own. Unlike many of the other coding resources online, the lessons here on <a href="https://519coding.ca/"  target="_blank">519coding.ca</a> focus on teaching coding in a way that's intuitive and easy to understand. This website was created by Trevor Du and Barry Zhang, two aspiring programmers in Grade 10. Read their bios below.</p>
