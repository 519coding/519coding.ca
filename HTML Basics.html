            <h1>First step of your journey.</h1>
            <p>Welcome to section 1/3 of our Web Design Course! In this section you'll be learning how to code the basic framework of a website using HTML. This lesson is the first of 6 in our HTML section. In this lesson, we'll be teaching you the basic structure of HTML as well as some key terms and concepts to know. </p>

            <h1>An basic HTML document</h1>
            <p>Here is an example of a super-simple HTML document, just to give you an basic idea of what you'll be working with:</p>
            <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
                     &lt;html&gt; <br>
                     &lt;head&gt; <br>
                     &lt;title&gt;This is our title!&lt;/title&gt; <br>
                     &lt;/head&gt; <br>
                     &lt;body&gt; <br>

                     &lt;h1&gt;Here is a heading&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                     &lt;p&gt;Here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; <br>

                     &lt;/body&gt; <br>
                     &lt;/html&gt; <br>
                     </code></p>
	        <p><a href="https://example--barryzhang1.repl.co/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the website created using this html document.</p>
		<h1>HTML elements</h1>
		<p>All HTML documents are comprised of many different components, which serve as the building blocks of a website. These building blocks are referred to as <i>elements</i>. HTML <i>elements</i> can be used to create a variety of different things for your website (i.e. Headings, captions, blocks of text).
		The example document above contains many useful elements that are used in almost every website. We'll explain them below:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> - This is not techinically an element since it doesn't create any visible content on your website. We type this out at the top of our HTML document to let the computer know that we are using the HTML language.</p>
		<p><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> - This element is called the "root" element of an HTML page. All the other elements of an HTML document are sandiwched inside of this element. Just like the previous element we described, this element does not generate any visible content onto your webpage.</p>
	        <p><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> - This element contains the title of your website, stylesheets, scripts (we'll get more into this later). Just like the two previous elements we described, this element does not generate anything onto your webpage.</p>
		<p><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> - This element is used to create a title for your website. The title of your website is displayed at the top of the browser tab, as shown below:
		<figure>
			<img src="Title.png"></img>
                        <figcaption>Fig. 1 - The &lt;title&gt; allows you to create a title for your website.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	        <p><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> - The &lt;body&gt; element contains the framwork for all of your website's visible content (i.e. Headings, paragraphs, sub-headings).</p>
	        <p><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> - This element is used to give your website headings. There are 6 heading sizes in html, numbered in descending order from &lt;h1&gt; all the way to &lt;h2&gt;, with &lt;h1&gt; being the largest heading and &lt;h2&gt;. Click the button below to see these headings in action:</p>
	        <p class = "click-button"><a href="https://repl.it/@BarryZhang1/Headings" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>
	        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> - The &lt;p&gt; is used to create paragraphs on your website. We'll talk more about this shortly.
	
	    <h1>HTML tags</h1>
	    <p>All HTML <i>elements</i> are made up of <i>tags</i>. Tags usually come in pairs, like so <code>&lt;p&gt; &lt;&#47p&gt;</code>. (Note that the second tag must have a forward slash &#8594; &#47. Kinda weird, but it's a rule. I guess it's so that you can distinguish between the two tags). The first tag is called the <i>opening tag</i> and the second tag is called the <i>closing tag</i>. Almost all HTML elements are represented by an opening tag followed by a closing tag, with the exception of special elements such as <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. Most elements however, contain both an opening tag and a closing tag. Think of it like a sandwich. The two tags are like the bread, and the content between the bread is all the tasty stuff.</p>
		    <p><code>
			    &lt;p&gt;</code> &#8594; this is your sandwich's bread <br>
			    <cool>This is the text that goes between your &lt;p&gt; and &lt;&#47p&gt; tags. This text is actually visible on your website, the tags just tell the computer that you are making a pargagraph. This is like the ham and cheese of your sandwich - the tasty stuff!</cool><br>
			    <code>&lt;&#47p&gt;</code> &#8594; this is your sandwich's bread<br>
