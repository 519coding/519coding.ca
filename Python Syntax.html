            <h1>What the Hell is a Syntax?</h1>
            <p>Whenever we speak or write, we always follow a certain set of <i>rules</i> that are required for a sentence to make sense. For example, "I like salami" makes sense, but "I salami" doesn't make much sense.</p>
            <p>All programming languages also have a set of rules that need to be followed when writing code, and it's called <i>syntax</i>. Since computers have a hard time understanding semantics (The meaning behind text that isn't explicitly stated) and take everything literally, syntax becomes especially important. Thankfully, Python syntax is extremely simple in comparison to some other languages (like C++ ;0). However, there are still some special rules that need to be followed.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>The Two Rules</h1>
            <h2>Indents and Colons</h2>
            <p>The first major rule that needs to be followed is that blocks of code contained within <i>function definitions</i>, <i>loops</i>, <i>conditional statements</i>, and <i>class definitions</i> (Don't worry about these right now, we'll learn about them later) must follow a colon and must be indented.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Indents and colons.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 1 - The print function on line 6 is not in the if statement because it's not indented.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Brackets</h2>
            <p>The second major rule is that all opening brackets must have its own distinct closing bracket.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Bracket Rules.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 2 - Line 2 raises an error because of a missing closing bracket.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <hr>
            <h1>Comments!</h1>
            <p>Comments are lines of text that aren't executed by the computer. They're useful because they can tell other programmers the reason why a piece of code was implemented (Remember: Others must be able to understand your code). Comments also allow you to temporarily remove a block of code without having to retype it, and also let you write reminders for yourself.</p>
            <h2>How's it Done?</h2>
            <p>You've actually already seen a comment! In Figure 1, the green text on line 1 is a comment. All single-line comments begin with a hash/pound/sharp sign (# will be called a hash symbol in these articles). Anything that comes after a hash symbol will be ignored.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Single-Line Comments.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 3 - Here are some comments!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Many other languages include multi-line comments, but Python doesn't technically have one. I say technically because you can use triple-quotation marks to convert a block of text into a string (You'll learn about strings soon) that will be ignored.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Multi-Line Comments.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 4 - What a cool multi-line comment)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>The Good, the Bad, the Ugly</h2>
            <p>Now, there are good comments, and there are not-so-good comments. Comments shouldn't tell you what the code does, that's usually clear to other programmers, comments should explain <strong>why</strong> a piece of code was written.</p>
            <h1>Print Functions</h1>
            <p>Unlike comments, print functions <strong>are read and executed by the computer</strong>. Print functions look like this: (You may have noticed them in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4)</p>
             <figure>
                <img src="Print Statements.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 5 - This is what a print function  looks like!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As you can see, a print function is made of two parts: The word "print" on the left side and a pair of parantheses containing the message you wish to write on the right side. The word "print" tells the computer that you want to print a message and the parantheses let the computer know what it is you want to print. Speaking of printing, you might be asking yourself "Where does the computer print my message?" Well, you see, Python's interface is made up of two components: The <i>editor</i> and the <i>compiler</i>. The <i>editor</i> is where we type stuff and tell our computer what to do. The <i>compiler</i> is where the computer translates our code into a messsage. You can think of the editor as the place where we <i>input</i> code and the compiler as the place where the computer <i>outputs</i> its interpretation of whatever we inputted into the editor.</p>

            <p>Now's the time for you to put your knowledge to the test! Click the button below and try typing comments and print functions into the editor. Next, click the small, green 'run' button at the top to see what the computer outputs in the small, black compiler window. Be sure to follow the proper syntax rules - Don't forget to enclose your message in quotation marks and parantheses for print functions.</p>
