About us:

The goal of this website is to introduce students of all ages to the world of coding and give them the skills and knowledge required to create projects of their own. Unlike many of the other coding resources online, the lessons here on https://519coding.ca focus on teaching coding in a way that's intuitive and easy to understand.

Our Courses:

We currently offer courses in Python and Web Design. For our Python course, we currently have 7 lessons on basic concepts. For our Web Design course, we currently have 5 lessons on HTML basics. We will be doing a content overhaul in the future where we add more lessons to our two existing courses.
