            <h1>The "Big Three" of Web Design.</h1>
            <p>Remember the Miami Heat, the basketball team that dominated the NBA not so long ago? Well, the Heat was centered a round the trio of Lebron James, Dwyayne Wade, and Chris Bosh, collectively known as "The Big Three". All three of the guys who made up the "Big Three" were superstars in their own right and each one of them played a different role for the team. Similarly, in the world of Web Design, there is  a trio of languages that are highly important, each one of them serving a different purpose in the process of developing a website. In Web Design, the "Big Three" are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll briefly go over them below.</p>  
            <hr>
            <h2>HTML: Structure</h2>
            <p>HTML is the first language we teach in our Web Design Course. HTML is used to lay out the foundation and structure of a website. With HTML, you can create headings, sub-headings, and blocks of text for your website. However, you cannot use HTML to dictate the size, colour, and postion of these headings, sub-headings, and blocks of text. To do that, you'll neeed to use CSS.</p>
             <figure>
                <img src="basic-html.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 1 - HTML can be used to dictate what elements you want on your website. However, your website can look pretty mundane if and dull if you don't incorporate CSS..</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <h2>CSS: Flair</h2>
            <p>CSS is responsible for dictating how your website appears. CSS can be used to alter the colour, size, and positioning of the various headings, sub-headings, and blocks of text you created using HTML. In short, CSS gives your website <i>style</i> and <i>flair</i></p>
             <figure>
                <img src="basic-css.png"></img>
                <figcaption>Fig. 2 - Now we've added CSS to the same website we showed in Fig. 1. Notice how we changed the colour of the heading to blue and the font of our paragraph text to Franklin Gothic Medium. Now our website looks a lot less boring.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <h2>JavaScript: The Brain</h2>
            <p>Lastly, JavaScript is used to make your website interactive and is responsible for managing the complex, behavioural aspects of your website. Without JavaScript, web pages are <i>static</i>, meaning that they offer no user interaction apart from maybe clicking links and loading new pages. Click the button below to see a cool implementation of JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>Becoming a Champion of Web Design</h2>
            <p>Miami's Big 3 proved that in order to dominate other teams, you need multiple superstar players on your roster. During their 4 seasons together, Miami reached the finals 4 consecutive times, winning 2 championships. However, once the "Big Three" parted ways, Miami never achieved the same success. Without Lebron James, the team was no longer a threat in terms of playmaking and attacking the basket. Without Dwyayne Wade, they were no longer a threat in terms of scoring and ball-handling. Without Chris Bosh, they were no longer a threat in terms of rebounding and defense. They needed all three members of the "Big Three" in order to be a successful, well-rounded team. Similarly, in order to excel at Web Design, you need to be skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each one of these three languages plays an important and unique role in developing a website. Without HTML, your website has no structure or foundation. Without CSS, your website looks mundane and dull. Without JavaScript, your website loses its interactive features and becomes static. Now that we've finished a brief overview of the "Big Three" of Web Design, it's time for you to start your journey in web design. Good luck!</p>
